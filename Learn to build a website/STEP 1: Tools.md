# Preparation:

- Node JS: Download in terminal to run JavaScript. (Must Search: YouTube)

- VS Code: Download 'Live Server' & 'Code Runner' extension. (You are all set!)

- AWS S3 Bucket: Register an account to host your website [ Your will need a card to pay AWS ] , remember to create a bucket name ( E.g kmy.top )that is the same as your desired domain_name. (Must Ask: ChatGPT)

- Name.com: Buy a Domain name (Or get a free one from the PRO pack), in 'Manage DNS' change the DNS record to direct the { AWS endpoint ANSWER: your_aws_website_endpoint E.g kmy.top.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com } to point to your Type 'A' { HOST: your_domain_name E.g kmy.top }. Then you just have to wait for 20 min for the DNS Propagation, while doing nothing, so grab a coffee and BOOM ! It's LIVE. (Must Ensure: No Errors in all your copy & paste)
